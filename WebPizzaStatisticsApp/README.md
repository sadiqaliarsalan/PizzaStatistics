# Web Pizza Statistics Application
The Web Pizza Statistics Application is a console-based tool that is specifically designed to handle the task of gathering and visualizing key point indicators for a pizza franchise. This application receives events that take place in pizza stores, such as orders being placed, deliveries being dispatched, payments being received, and feedback from customers. The application then tracks statistics related to customer orders, loyalty membership, and earned loyalty points.

## Features

Real-time Event Processing: Process events received over a TCP connection in real-time, updating statistics based on the event type and customer ID.

Statistics Tracking: Track statistics such as the number of orders placed, completed orders, loyalty membership status, and loyalty points earned by customers.

## Assignment
Please improve the code to make it more understandable and easier to maintain. It's important to note that the Web Pizza Statistics Application will be expanded in the future with new features such as Inventory Management, Loyalty Membership, and Customer Feedback. The Inventory Management feature will help keep track of the inventory levels of pizza ingredients and update them as orders are placed and pizzas are prepared. The new Loyalty Membership feature will keep track of the most popular pizza ingredients and types for each loyalty member. Lastly, the Customer Feedback feature will track the feedback received from customers and update statistics accordingly.

## Usage
Run the Web Pizza Statistics Application. 

Then, run one or several Web Pizza EventSimulator Applications to simulate events occurring within the pizza stores.
